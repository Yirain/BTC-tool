##  Dependence

* OpenSSL-dev          1.1.0
* libcurl4-openssl-dev 7.58.0
* cJSON                1.7.5

##  Enviroment

* Ubuntu 18.04 (Kernel 4.15.0-23)
* GCC 7.3

## Features

### Current

* Generate bitcoin address.
* BaseX Encode/Decode
* Check address validation and get the hash160 value
* Check private key validaion and get the address

### Future

* Create and sign the raw transactions.
* Broadcast the signed transaction.
* Get the balance and UTXO on an address.

##  Usage

	sudo apt install libssl-dev
    sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev

	make
    
	./btctool [-sctk] [-a <address>] [-g <privkey>]
              [--base6e -S <string>] [--base6d -L <string>]
              [--base58e -F <string>] [--base58d -W <string>]

	Options:
    -s                           Get a standard mainnet address.
    -c                           Get a compressed mainnet address.
    -t                           Get a standard testnet address.
    -k                           Get a compressed testnet address.
    -a <address>                 Check addess validaion and get the hash160 value.
    -g <privkey>                 Check private key validaion and get the address.
