##  Dependence

* OpenSSL-1.0.2g
* Libcurl-7.47.0
* cJSON-1.7.5

##  Enviroment

* Linux Kernel 4.10.0-28-generic_x64
* GCC 5.4.0

## Features

### Current

* Generate bitcoin address.
* BaseX Encode/Decode
* Check address validation and get the hash160 value
* Check private key validaion and get the address

### Future

* Create and sign the raw transactions.
* Broadcast the signed transaction.
* Get the balance and UTXO on an address.

##  Usage

	sudo apt install libssl-dev
    sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev

	make
    
	./btctool [-sctk] [-a <address>] [-g <privkey>] [--base6e -S <string>]
              [--base6d -L <string>] [--base58e -F <string>] [--base58d -W <string>]
              [--base58checke -B <string>] [--base58checkd -T <string>]
	
	Options:
    -s                           Get a standard mainnet address.
    -c                           Get a compressed mainnet address.
    -t                           Get a standard testnet address.
    -k                           Get a compressed testnet address.
    -a <address>                 Check addess validaion and get the hash160 value.
    -g <privkey>                 Check private key validaion and get the address.
